Testing architecture - VSCode IDE using JavaSE-21 and bash terminal

Test cases -
    Test 1: Can a Content Server and client connect to the Aggregation server?
        Steps:
            run AggregationServer.java
            run ContentServer.java
            run Client.java
        Result:
            Content Server and Client connected to the Aggregation Server

    Test 2: Can I send a .json file from a Content Server to the Aggregation Server 
            to a Client?
        Steps:
            run AggregationServer.java
            run ContentServer.java with arguments "127.0.0.2", "4567" and "Input.txt"
            run client.java
            have ContentServer request a PUT to AggregationServer
            Have Client tequest a GET to AggregationServer
        Result:
            The "Input.txt" is sent to both the Aggregations Server and the Client as 
            a .json file

    Test 3: Does the Content Server generate a .json file from the "Input.txt"?
        Steps:
            run ContentServer.java with arguments "127.0.0.2", "4567" and "Input.txt"
        Result:
            A file named "ContentServer.json" is generated based on the "Input.txt" file

    Test 4: Can multiple Content Servers and clients connect to, PUT and GET from 
            one Aggregation server?
        Steps:
            run AggregationServer.java once
            run ContentServer.java twice and have each PUT once
            run Client.java three times and have each GET once
        Result:
            Content Servers are able to PUT and Clients are able to GET .json files correctly. 
            However, only one copy of each block of json data is stored in the Aggregation 
            server.

    Test 5: Does the Lamport Clock keep track of ticks?
        Steps:
            run AggregationServer.java
            run ContentServer.java
            run Client.javac
            Use the command "test" in the terminal of each program in the following order...
                Aggregation -> Content -> Aggregation -> Client -> Aggregation -> Aggregation 
                -> Content -> Client -> Content
        Result:
            The ticks for each program is correctly kept track of

    Test 6: Does the Aggregation Server remove .json files from Content Server it has not 
            communicated with in the last 30 seconds?
        Steps:
            run AggregationServer.java
            run ContentServer.java
            Apply a "PUT" with Content Server
            Wait 15 seconds and use command "test" in terminal of ContentServer.java
            Wait 30 seconds
        Result:
            The AggregationSErver.json is cleared only after 30 of inactivity from 
            the Content Server 

    Test 7: Does the Content Server and Client retry on errors?
        Steps:
            run ContentServer.java
            run Client.javac
            run AggregationServer.java
            wait 5 seconds
        Result:
            Content Server and Client successfully connect to Aggregation Server
